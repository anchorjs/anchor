   * contain a single node, in which case it can be logically thought of as the
   * node itself rather than a collection.
   *
   * `Collection` has a number of functions that simplify operations on the DOM.
   * When these functions are invoked, they are carried out on all nodes in the
   * collection.  The technique of wrapping DOM nodes in a `Collection` and
   * invoking utility functions simplifies operations on the DOM.

   *   - the node
   *   - the index of the node
   *   - the collection being iterated over
   *
   * `each()` is aliased to `forEach()` in order to appear `Array`-like.
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   *     col.each(function(node) {
   *       // ...
   *     });
   *
   *     col.each(function(node, i) {

   * Transition from jQuery or Zepto:
   *
   * This function provides similar functionality to jQuery's `each()`, but
   * differs in the order of the arguments passed to `fn`.  In jQuery, the index
   * is the first argument and the element is the second argument.  In Anchor,
   * this order is swapped.  Additionally, in jQuery `this` always refers to the
   * element; whereas in Anchor `this` is determined by `scope`.
   *
   * These differences are intentional, and in conformance to the ECMAScript 5
   * standard for `Array#forEach`.
   *
   * Transition from Ender/Bonzo:
   *
   * This function is compatible with Bonzo, with the caveat that `forEach` is
   * not aliased by Bonzo.
   *
   *
   * @param {Function} fn Function to execute for each element.
   * @param {Object} scope Object to use as `this` when executing `fn`.
   * @return {Collection} for chaining
